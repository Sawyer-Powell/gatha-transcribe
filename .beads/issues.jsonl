Infrastructure Setup\n- Install and configure Playwright for the project\n- Set up test environment (dev server + backend)\n- Configure test database isolation\n- Create test helpers and utilities\n\n### 2. Core User Flows\n- **Authentication Flow**: Register → Login → Logout → Re-login\n- **Video Upload Flow**: Upload → Progress indication → Playback\n- **Protected Routes**: Redirect when not authenticated\n- **Session Persistence**: Login survives page refresh\n\n### 3. Test Architecture\n- Reusable fixtures for authenticated sessions\n- Database seeding/cleanup helpers\n- Video file fixtures for testing\n- Screenshot/video capture on failure\n\n### 4. CI Integration\n- Tests run in CI pipeline\n- Headless execution\n- Parallel test execution where possible\n- Clear failure reporting\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All critical user flows have E2E tests\n- Tests are reliable (no flakiness)\n- Tests run quickly (\u003c 30s for full suite)\n- Easy to add new E2E tests for future features\n- Clear documentation on writing E2E tests\n\n## Future Use\n- This infrastructure will be essential for testing transcription features\n- Video playback synchronization with transcription blocks\n- Real-time transcription updates via WebSocket\n- Transcription chunk editing and retranscription","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"sawyerhpowell@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-12T19:59:41.170777-08:00","created_by":"Sawyer Powell","updated_at":"2026-01-12T20:49:51.840522-08:00"}

Serialization Test\n- Verify that sessions serialize correctly to the database\n- Ensure all session fields are properly stored\n- Test that serialized data maintains integrity\n\n### 2. Reliability Test\n- Verify that sessions can be reliably retrieved after persistence\n- Test session lifecycle: create → persist → retrieve → validate\n- Ensure no data loss or corruption during the persistence cycle\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- At least one comprehensive test covering serialization to DB\n- At least one test verifying reliability of the persistence mechanism\n- Tests should use the existing test infrastructure (tests/common/mod.rs helpers)\n- All tests must pass consistently\n\n## Context\nSession persistence is a core security/functionality component. Without automated tests, we risk regressions that could affect authentication and user sessions.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"sawyerhpowell@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-12T19:45:25.677078-08:00","created_by":"Sawyer Powell","updated_at":"2026-01-12T20:18:31.938182-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T20:18:31.938182-08:00","close_reason":"Added comprehensive session persistence tests covering serialization, reliability, default values, batch operations, and edge cases.

Initial Upload Flow\n- Videos support playback immediately after upload\n- Show 'Begin Transcribing' action button for untranscribed videos\n- Button kicks off transcription task\n\n### 2. Transcription Task Architecture\n- **Resumable**: Active progress saving during transcription\n- **Real-time sync**: Updates VideoSession object continuously via WebSocket\n- **Streaming updates**: Send messages when:\n  - New chunk transcription starts\n  - Chunk content is transcribed (stream text as it arrives)\n- **Frontend states**: Add 'transcribing' state to transcription blocks\n- **User editing**: Allow modification of completed chunks immediately after completion\n- **Stoppable**: Users can stop transcription mid-process\n\n### 3. Chunk Retranscription\n- Icon to left of play button on each transcription block\n- Confirmation modal before retranscribing\n- Uses same transcription pipeline\n\n### 4. Progress Indication\n- Show progress circle in sidebar during active transcription\n- May require Server-Sent Events (SSE) since current WebSocket is per-video\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Audio Processing Pipeline\n1. **Silence Detection**: Use FFmpeg silence detection to identify non-speech regions\n2. **Chunking**: Break audio into 30s-1min chunks on silence boundaries (avoid mid-word splits)\n3. **Silence Removal**: Strip silence from chunks before transcription to reduce data transfer\n4. **Chunk Storage**: Store metadata about each chunk\n\n### Transcription Backend\n- **Trait-based design**: Create 'Transcriber' trait for swappable backends\n- **Initial implementation**: Local Whisper model (small/simple)\n- **Future**: Cloud-based model via same trait\n- **Streaming output**: Emit text as a stream, not full strings\n- **Real-time delivery**: Stream transcribed text to frontend transcription blocks\n\n## Development Approach\n- Start with backend implementation\n- Small, verifiable units of work (easy to review completely)\n- **Every unit requires automated tests**\n- Incremental, testable progress\n\n## Architecture Considerations\n- WebSocket per-video for transcription updates\n- Consider SSE for global progress indicators\n- VideoSession object as source of truth\n- Frontend/backend sync via existing real-time system","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"sawyerhpowell@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-12T19:42:56.886556-08:00","created_by":"Sawyer Powell","updated_at":"2026-01-12T19:42:56.886556-08:00"}
